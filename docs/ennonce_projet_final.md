Project Overview 🦁1200 min
Objective:
Your task is to develop a fully functional MLOps pipeline that automates the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model. You will
start by finding your own dataset, train a model, and then build the infrastructure needed for deployment, monitoring, continuous
training, and more.
This project will test your ability to independently manage the full spectrum of data science and machine learning operations,
focusing on building a scalable, automated pipeline that works in real-world scenarios.
Project Overview
1. Find Your Dataset and Prepare the Data
You are responsible for finding a dataset that is both challenging and relevant to a real-world problem. This can come from any
publicly available source, or you can collect the data yourself. The dataset should be complex enough to challenge your skills in
model training and MLOps implementation.
Once you have the data, you’ll need to clean and preprocess it. This includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and
balancing the data as needed. Think about feature engineering to maximize model performance.
2. Model Training

---
You’ll need to train a machine learning model based on the dataset you chose. Select a relevant algorithm based on the problem
you are trying to solve (e.g., classification, regression, clustering). Use frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn to train
and evaluate your model.
Justify the choice of your algorithm.
Tune hyperparameters to optimize the model’s performance.
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
Your model should be robust and ready for real-world deployment.
3. Build an MLOps Pipeline
Now comes the main challenge: building a pipeline that can automate the process of training, deploying, monitoring, and
retraining the model. Here’s what you’ll need to do:
a. Model Deployment
Deploy the model using Docker or Kubernetes, and make it available via a REST API. Your deployment should be scalable, capable
of handling real-time data and requests. You can choose cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or work on-premise.
b. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Automate the model deployment process using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins. Set up automated testing,
validation, and deployment pipelines that trigger whenever the model is updated.
c. Monitoring and Logging

---
Implement tools like Aporia or Evidently to monitor your model in production. This includes tracking metrics like latency, accuracy,
and drift detection. Ensure that your model stays within performance standards, and set up alerts for when it drifts or its accuracy
falls below a certain threshold.
d. Automated Model Retraining
Create a retraining pipeline that automatically kicks in when the performance metrics indicate model drift or when new data
becomes available. Use tools like Apache Airflow or Kubeflow to automate the process, ensuring that the model gets updated
seamlessly.
e. Versioning and Rollback
Use tools like DVC or MLflow to handle data and model versioning. You should be able to roll back to a previous version of your
model if the new one doesn’t perform as expected.
f. API Development and Documentation
Develop APIs for interacting with your deployed model. Make sure your APIs are well-documented, clearly explaining the inputs,
outputs, and usage for others to integrate.
What to Submit
Dataset and Preprocessing Report: Clearly explain the dataset you chose, how you preprocessed it, and the reasoning behind
your data transformations.
Trained Model Notebook or Script: A notebook or script showing how you trained and evaluated your model, including
hyperparameter tuning and final performance metrics.

Key Evaluation Criteria
1. Data Preparation and Model Performance: Did you select a meaningful dataset, preprocess it properly, and train a high-
performance model?
2. Pipeline Completeness: Does your MLOps pipeline handle the entire lifecycle from deployment to monitoring and retraining?
3. Automation: How well have you automated the processes for deployment and retraining? Is the system robust enough to
handle changes in data or performance?
4. Scalability and Monitoring: Can your pipeline scale to handle larger data volumes and heavier user loads? Is the monitoring
system proactive and effective?
5. Documentation and Usability: Is the pipeline clearly documented and accessible for future developers or stakeholders?
